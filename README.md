# PredicateManageEmployees

In Java 8, Predicate is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference. So, where you think, we can use these true/false returning functions in day to day programming? I will say you can use predicates anywhere where you need to evaluate a condition on group/collection of similar objects such that evaluation can result either in true or false.
